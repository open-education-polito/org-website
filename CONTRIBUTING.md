There are several ways to contribute to this repo.

## Creating a new content

This repo uses Jekyll, a static content generation framework. 
As such, in order to add a new page, it is necessary to do the following steps:

1. Fork the repository (if you don't have already a copy in your own Github space)
2. Enter the `_posts` folder
3. Possibly copy an existing entry and name it in the following way: ```YYYY-MM-DD-title.md```
4. Modify the header of the file accordingly
5. Test locally. This can be done via the command `bundle exec jekyll serve` or using the Dockerfile included in the root.
6. Push your changes
7. Make a Pull Request

Your PR will then be reviewed and, eventually, merged by the maintainers.

Thanks for your contribution!
