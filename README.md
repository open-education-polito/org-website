# Open Education Polito Website

This website is built using Jekyll.

## Getting started for a local deployment

`bundle install`

You can build the site and make it available on a local server with:

`bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_dev.yml`

### Notes

You can run the server just with `bundle exec jekyll serve`: the website will
be available on http://localhost:4000/design-jeyll-theme. This is the default
settings to allow usage with GitHub pages.

The aforementioned addition of `_config_dev.yml` is needed to run the server on
http://localhost:4000 without any subpath.
